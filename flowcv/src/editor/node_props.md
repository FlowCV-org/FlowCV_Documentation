# Working With Node Properties

The properties panel will display the parameters for various nodes.

The property panel can be docked or undocked and moved where ever you prefer.

To activate / show a node property control in the panel simply double click on a node.

To highlight a node property section when multiple node properties are active at once simply double click on the node you want to highlight and the title section will turn green.

Click on the x in the title bar to remove the node property from the list.

You can also collapse the node property section if you want to keep it in the list but just want it out of the way temporarily.
