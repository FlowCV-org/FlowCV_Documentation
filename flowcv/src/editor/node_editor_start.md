# Node Editor

![editor](../images/flowcv_ui.jpg)

The Node Editor User Interface is the front end interface for creating flow graphs, this is where you will create new nodes, connect the various inputs and outputs and configure parameters.

The Node Editor is built on top of the dataflow framework as an easy way to visually connect and configure nodes but the UI is not a dependency of the dataflow framework so if anyone wanted to they could build their own UI on top of FlowCV if for example they wanted to make a web based front end.

There are various [elements to the UI](ui_elements.md) and viewer nodes that allow you to interactively see the results of your flow graph in real-time.
