# Help Needed

While there has been a lot of ground worked laid down already there is still a lot of work left to do.

Here is a list of things that are still needed (but no where near a complete list)
* More OpenCV functionality implemented as nodes... lots more!! (this is probably where I need the most help because there is so much to do)
* More camera hardware plugin support (MYNT EYE, Azure Kinect DK, Flir machine vision... just to name a few)
* Other computer vision or machine learning algorithms that aren't part of OpenCV
* ROS 2 integration / support
* Beta testing
* Making example / tutorial / how-to videos
* And much much more

If you would like to help with any of these things or have other ideas that you think would be good to implement please check out the [contributor](contribute.md) section and become a contributor to help out!
